A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once and storing there solutions

Overlapping subproblems
A problem is said to have Overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems whach are reused several times

Optimal Substructure
A problem is said to have if an optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
