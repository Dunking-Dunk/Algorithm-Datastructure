Very similiar to a binary search tree, but with some diffrent rules!

in a MaxBinaryHeap, parent node are always larger than child nodes
in a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

why do we need binary heaps
    Binary Heaps are used to implement priority queues which are very commonly used data structure
    they are also used quite a bith with graph traversal algorithm
