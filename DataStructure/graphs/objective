What are graph?
A graph dataStructure consists of a finite(and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an underected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph

uses:
    social Networking
    Location / Mapping
    Routing Algorithms
    Visual Hierarchy
    File System Optimisations
    EveryWhere 

Essential Graph Term
    vertex - a nodes
    Edge - connectioon between nodes
    weighted/unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
    directed/undirected - direction assigned to distanced between vertices

we use adjacency Matrix to store the graph

Graph traversal uses
    peer to peer networking
    web crawlers
    finding closest matches/recommendations
    shortest path problem
        gps navigation
        solving mazes
